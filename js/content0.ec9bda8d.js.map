I loved the aesthetic and was inspired to create something similar. In the video description, I saw a file with a `.py` extension. I googled it and discovered the **Python** programming language.\\n\\nI figured out how to run scripts: I installed the interpreter, the dependencies, and ran the code. Opening the file in a text editor, I saw familiar English words: `if`, `else`, `import`. The code seemed surprisingly logical, even though I knew nothing about programming.\\n\\nFirst, I changed the text banner from FleeFy's nickname to my own, and then I got curious about how to change the text colors. I started asking programmers in chat groups, and they helped me make some edits. It's important to note that I still didn't know the basics—essentially, nothing. My first program was \\\"stolen,\\\" but with my own minor design changes.\\n\\nThen, I wondered how to turn the code into an `.exe` file so no one could read it. After a few evenings with Google, I managed to do it. And so, on May 13, 2021, I started my own channel and released my first program.\\n\\n## First Projects and First Successes\\n\\nI didn't stop there. Just two days later, I released an SMS bomber. I found this program as well and adapted it for myself. I didn't touch the spamming algorithm because I didn't know how, but I did learn to create interactive menus using `if-else`.\\n\\nAfter that, I started to study how the **vk_api** works. It turned out not to be that difficult. I got a basic understanding of APIs and began to write my own software. In 2021, I created an impressive amount of tools:\\n\\n*   **VKC 1.0** - VK Comment Booster (May 18, 2021)\\n*   **VKP 1.0** - VK Photo Booster (June 3, 2021)\\n*   **VKC 2.0** - VK Comment Booster (June 10, 2021)\\n*   **VKL 1.0** - VK Music Booster (June 12, 2021)\\n*   **VKSUB 1.0** - VK Subscriber Booster (June 23, 2021)\\n*   **TTVIEWER 1.0** - TikTok View Booster (June 30, 2021)\\n*   **VKV 1.0** - VK View Booster (July 5, 2021)\\n*   **VKLIKER 1.0** - VK Like Booster (July 9, 2021)\\n*   **VKSMS 2.0** - VK Message Booster (July 16, 2021)\\n*   **VKMP4 1.0** - VK Video Booster (July 26, 2021)\\n*   **VKT 1.0** - VK Account Growth Tool (August 3, 2021)\\n*   **WindowsActivator 1.0** - Windows Activation without a key (August 10, 2021)\\n*   **VKSTEPS 1.0** - VK Steps Booster (August 22, 2021)\\n*   **VKSTEPS 2.0** - VK Steps Booster (August 31, 2021)\\n*   **VKP 2.0** - VK Photo Booster (September 5, 2021)\\n*   **VKSMS 3.0** - VK Message Booster with accounts (September 8, 2021)\\n*   **WINDOWS ACTIVATOR 2.0** - Free Windows Activation without a key (September 18, 2021)\\n*   **VKL 2.0** - VK Music Plays Booster without accounts (October 20, 2021)\\n*   **VKC 3.0** - VK Comment Booster with captcha solving (December 29, 2021)\\n\\nYeah, not a small list ^\\\\_^\\n\\n### First Earnings\\n\\nIn addition to developing free software, I began to monetize my skills. I offered **premium boosting services**: quickly and in large quantities, I boosted likes, subscribers, comments, and more. I also sold **premium versions of my programs** that worked several times faster and had extended functionality. This was how I earned my first money, long before I started freelancing.\\n\\n## Collaboration and a New Level\\n\\nI gained popularity in the VK boosting community and my software became as popular as **FleeFy's**. He saw my talent, and we collaborated on **VKL 2.0**. This tool was more unique than the others. By then, I had learned to make GUI programs with **tkinter**, having practiced on \\\"WindowsActivator 1.0.\\\" For VKL 2.0, I brought in a designer I knew and built the program based on his mockup.\\n\\n## Final Project in 9th Grade\\n\\nFor my final project in the 9th grade, I prepared a neural network that solved captchas. Of course, I didn't write and train it myself. As was tradition, I found a library on GitHub, extracted the weights, wrote my own code for inference, and improved the logic. I also used this model in my own boosting software to bypass VK's captcha. I defended my project without any issues.\\n\\n# A New Stage: College\\n\\n## 1st Year: Deep Dive into Development\\n\\nIn college, I got tired of writing boosting tools and wanted something more. I started learning advanced methods for creating GUIs and came across **PyQt**. It seemed very complicated. I struggled with it for a month but couldn't understand how to work with it. The problem wasn't Qt itself, but my lack of knowledge in **OOP**. I had a rough idea of how to write classes, but `self` was a complete mystery to me.\\n\\nIt was then that I found the YouTube channel **ZProger**, who became my new idol. Thanks to him, I mastered OOP, understood the importance of clean code, and quickly got the hang of Qt. I started writing small programs and learned how to create custom widgets.\\n\\n### Spectrum Security: The First Serious Project\\n\\nFrom September to December, I worked on my first project that I'm still proud of today: **Spectrum Security**. It was a local antivirus with an interface built on Qt. I was more proud of the interface than the functionality.\\n\\nI tried several approaches for virus detection:\\n*   **Hash checking**: I abandoned this due to the huge local database required.\\n*   **Checking via VirusTotal**: I abandoned this due to slow scans and limitations.\\n*   **Checking using machine learning**: I chose this option.\\n\\nOf course, I found the model on GitHub and adapted it to my interface. The virus detection wasn't perfect, but the program worked. This was the project I submitted for my first-year final.\\n\\n### Freelancing and Telegram Bots\\n\\nAround the same time, I discovered Telegram and its bots. In VK, they were not great, but in Telegram, everything was convenient and well-designed. This is how I started making money. I got into freelancing and found a long-term client with whom I worked for two years. He needed a Telegram bot for selling VK boosting services. Over time, I earned about 100,000 rubles from this project. I still develop Telegram bots today, as it is a very profitable field.\\n\\n## 2nd Year: Diving into AI and Linux\\n\\nIn my second year, I began to explore the world of AI and **Linux (Manjaro)**. I had used machine learning models before, but I didn't understand how they worked. It was time to figure it out.\\n\\n### Hackathons and First Victories\\n\\nI learned about hackathons, gathered a team of friends, and went to my first one. We were tasked with creating a recommendation algorithm for the **RuTube** video platform. We didn't place high, but the event was a catalyst for my journey into AI.\\n\\nThere, I met a person who knew a lot about neural networks. Thanks to him, I continued to participate in hackathons and delved deeper into the development and training of AI models. In six months, I participated in 6 hackathons and won 1st place in an international one! My team and I created **\\\"IntelliGate - a smart barrier,\\\"** a computer vision model that automatically opened a barrier for special government vehicles. Later, we presented this project at the international Euro-Asian IT-forum in Moscow. It was an unforgettable experience.\\n\\nHere is a list of hackathons I participated in during my second year:\\n\\n| Date | Name | Location | Result | Link |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| May 17, 2024 | AI-sport-tech — SportTechCup 2024 (Final) | St. Petersburg | 3rd | [Details](https://it-planet.braim.org/2024/ai-sport.html) |\\n| Apr 15, 2024 | AI-sport-tech — SportTechCup 2024 (Online Qualifier) | Online | Finalist | [Details](https://it-planet.braim.org/2024/ai-sport.html) |\\n| Apr 19, 2024 | International Online Hackathon \\\"Digital Transformation of Agriculture\\\" | International.

Around that time, ZProger posted his dotfiles for **Arch Linux**. I gave it a try and fell in love with the **bspwm** tiling window manager.\\n\\nI started with his dotfiles and gradually began to make my own changes. This is how my second legendary project was born: **meowrch**. I tried to create my own unique distribution for programmers, offering a beautiful design and all the conveniences for coding.\\n\\n## 3rd Year: From Open Source to Business\\n\\nIn my third year, I realized I was spending too much time on Open Source. I wasn't getting valuable prizes from hackathons, and my efforts weren't being rewarded.\\n\\n### Return to Freelancing\\n\\nI decided to quit hackathons and think about business. I returned to freelancing and started earning money. The project fees grew, and I began to charge over $1000 per project.\\n\\n### The Development of meowrch\\n\\nIn parallel, I continued to work on my new creation, **meowrch**. I started promoting it passively, and it gained a lot of traction (by the end of my 3rd year, I had 700 stars on GitHub). I developed my own status bar called **mewline** and a system for automatically changing themes for all applications on Linux using Git. All of this is being prepared for the third version of meowrch, which will be ready for release at the beginning of my 4th year.\\n\\n### Scientific Activity and the First Patent\\n\\nA new branch of my development began this year. My father, who had earned his Candidate of Sciences degree (Ph.D. equivalent), introduced me to a Doctor of Sciences in the field of agricultural engineering who needed a programmer's help. In short, the task was to develop a program that could monitor multiple USB endoscopes connected through a USB hub. The problem was that a single USB port, which the hub occupied, couldn't handle more than two video streams at once. I solved this problem and received my first patent for the program.\\n\\nOf course, I'm not stopping there and am already preparing a second patent. But I'll tell you about that in a future episode ;)\\n\\n\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
